# Working Title:RetroPie
# Name of Lead Designer(s): 
Steven Truong

* Theme/Look:

## Materials & Methods
_What programing language will you be using? If you are not planing to use Processing explain why you chose a different programing language._
<H2>I will most likely not be using a language for programming as the installation for RetroPie is done through cmd line and img files that can install the os for me.</h2>

## Program Specifications
_Fully describe your project below in one paragraph (minimum 5 sentences). Is it a game? A tool? If it is a game, what game genre is it?_
<h2> I will be designing a RetroPie emulator/station; a operating system that can run old classics of the N64 and NES era specifically the Super Smash Bros series. Through tutorials, I will try to implement and enable different controller inputs for the user to gain the best experience.</h2>
## Potential Challenges
_Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?_
<h1>Potential Challenges</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Controller will not be recognized/connect. -Debug and/or reinstall drivers</li>
	<li>Possibility that games will not run "functionally. -Solved through overclocking perhaps?</li>
</ul>
<h2>If there are any challenges I cannot fix, I will ask for help, but if it cannot be fixed -I will attempt to reinstall the OS and find a 'better' tutorial for installation.
## Time Line
_Describe in detail what you will complete by the end of each week (end of Friday class)._
* Week 1:Install RetroPie packages.
* Week 2:Install RetroPie OS
* Week 3:
* Week 4:
* Week 5:

	<li>Functional RetroPie enviroment</li>
	<li>Can run a functional emulator + game</li>
</ul>
## 80%
_What does 80% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 80%._
<h2> 80% will look like a RetroPie with a fully functional controller's</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Will have functionality with at least two different controllers (ps3,ps4,keyboard).</li>
</ul>
## 90+%
_What does 90+% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 90+%._
