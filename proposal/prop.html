## Materials & Methods
_What programing language will you be using? If you are not planing to use Processing explain why you chose a different programing language._
<p>I will most likely not be using a language for programming as the installation for RetroPie is done through cmd line and img files that can install the os for me.</p>
<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Manual-Installation/">Installation onto Raspbian OS</a>

## Program Specifications
_Fully describe your project below in one paragraph (minimum 5 sentences). Is it a game? A tool? If it is a game, what game genre is it?_
<p> I will be designing a RetroPie emulator/station; a operating system that can run old classics of the N64 and NES era specifically the Super Smash Bros series. Through tutorials, I will try to implement and enable different controller inputs for the user to gain the best experience. My Raspberry Pie will not be limited to just RetroPie however as I want to keep it as a functional work station; therefore I will install it onto Raspbian itself -allowing me to switch between enviroments</p>
## Potential Challenges
_Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?_
<h1>Potential Challenges</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Controller will not be recognized/connect. -Debug and/or reinstall drivers</li>
	<li>Possibility that games will not run "functionally. -Solved through overclocking perhaps?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any challenges I cannot fix, I will ask for help, but if it cannot be fixed -I will attempt to reinstall the OS and find a 'better' tutorial for installation.</p>
## Time Line
_Describe in detail what you will complete by the end of each week (end of Friday class)._
* Week 1:Install RetroPie packages and Raspbian Updates.
* Week 2:Install RetroPie OS
* Week 3:Install Controller Drivers and test connection
* Week 4:Test with games
* Week 5:Debug

# Evaluation
## 60%
_What will a 60% project look like?  In other words, what is the minimum expectations you have for yourself?  List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 60%._
<h2>My minimum expectation will just be installing RetroPie itself as I believe this is the easiest part of the project.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Functional RetroPie enviroment</li>
	<li>Can run a functional emulator + game</li>
	<li>Can alternate between RetroPie and Pixel Desktop Enviroment</li>
</ul>
## 80%
_What does 80% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 80%._
<h2> 80% will look like a RetroPie with a fully functional controller's</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Will have functionality with at least two different controllers (ps3,ps4,keyboard).</li>
</ul>
## 90+%
_What does 90+% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 90+%._
<h1>90% will have the ability to transfer games "wirelessly." -Move games from my computer to the pie</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Move games from my computer to the pie wirelessly. Dropbox perhaps?</li>
</ul>
