# Log Message for Major Project for Week 3
## What was your goal for the past week?
Install bluetooth/PS4 drivers for my Retropie to work and recognize Sony's PS4 controller. 
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Although I was following a video on how to install ps4 drivers I ran into issues of not being able to install the driver for some apparent reason. Therefore, I will have to follow a different tutorial.
## What did you learn this week?
Installing drivers for the controller isn't as simple as downloading packages/drivers. Having to map out keys/buttons on the controller to the emulater you are using is still a daunting task. It can be configured through RetroPi but it is usually better to edit configuration files per controller and emulator.
## What is your goal for next week?
Try to install the bluetooth/PS4 drivers again. Perhaps a wired connection would be easier and reliable versus wireless.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
Trying different methods to install controllers.
