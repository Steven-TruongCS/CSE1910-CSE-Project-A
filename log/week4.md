# Log Message for Major Project for Week 4
## What was your goal for the past week?
Try again to install the PS4 controller drivers.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
I did not accomplish this yet but am currently working on it. Upon researching for installation guides, I learned that a wireless adapter can be used if necessary -to connect with the ps4 controller atleast.
## What did you learn this week?
Sony has a wireless adapter that can be bought to pair with the controller wirelessly if needed.
## What is your goal for next week?
Be able to use my controller with proper mapping/configurations to the "emulated controller."
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
