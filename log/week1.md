# Log Message for Major Project for Week 1
## What was your goal for the past week?
Install the basic packages needed; updating raspbian packages and installing RetroPie scripts/packages for installation.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Yes, I have installed the fundamental packages needed to install RetroPie through the command line. From there, further installations were needed and were later installed.  
## What did you learn this week?
This week, I have learned about the different methods to install RetroPie. You can install it as an OS or as a "overlay" built onto Raspbian. It can be run from the Pixel Desktop with the command, emulationstation and return to pixel enviroment with command, startx.
## What is your goal for next week?
Thanks to the process of installing the preRetroPie packages/OS, I am now looking forward to installing the RetroPie operating system itself onto my RetroPie and configure controls. (Installing drivers for controllers i.e Ps3,Ps4)
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
Other than the length of time needed to install these packages, there are none currently.
