# Log Message for Major Project for Week 5
## What was your goal for the past week?
To get a functioning/syncing PS4/PS3 controller with my RetroPi. I've decided to modify my goals however and stuck to a wired connection instead of a bluetooth connection for convenience due to complications that come with Sony drivers. (Will cause other bluetooth devices to not work.)
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
I accomplished this goal and got a PS3 and PS4 controller to work in conjunction and mappings are saved throughout the emulations.
## What did you learn this week?
Bluetooth drivers, atleast for Sony devices, come with complications that restrict the utility in your RetroPi when using bluetooth connections.
## What is your goal for next week?
Just to test test and test. I've already brought this to school and let my friends play it. So far they are satisfied and there's little to no problems occuring -other then the random lags that occur but that may be due to certain characters. Perhaps overclock the Pi?
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
N/A
