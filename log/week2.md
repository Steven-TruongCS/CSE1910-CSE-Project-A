# Log Message for Major Project for Week 2
## What was your goal for the past week?
Install RetroPie operating system onto my Raspberry Pi but retaining the pixel/Raspbian enviroment itself. This can be done by installing RetroPie manually from the command line and install the necessary packages onto Raspbian(emulaters and such)
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Thanks to the process of installing the drivers smoothly onto my Raspberry Pi, I have now installed the RetroPie OS onto my Raspbian Pi with the functionality to switch between EmulationStation and Pixel enviroment.
## What did you learn this week?
A small yet significant detail -The Raspberry Pi 3.0 supports bluetooth; therefore I can possibily connect the controller with wireless bluetooth and wired connection.
## What is your goal for next week?
Install and setup/configure drivers for my controllers to connect to the Raspberry.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
None currently.
